Sample: simpleVulkan
Minimum spec: SM 3.0

This sample demonstrates Vulkan CUDA Interop. CUDA imports the Vulkan vertex buffer and operates on it to create sinewave, and synchronizes with Vulkan through vulkan semaphores imported by CUDA. This sample depends on Vulkan SDK, GLFW3 libraries, for building this sample please refer to "Build_instructions.txt" provided in this sample's directory

Key concepts:
Graphics Interop
CUDA Vulkan Interop
Data Parallel Algorithms
