Sample: lineOfSight
Minimum spec: SM 3.0

This sample is an implementation of a simple line-of-sight algorithm: Given a height map and a ray originating at some observation point, it computes all the points along the ray that are visible from the observation point. The implementation is based on the Thrust library.
